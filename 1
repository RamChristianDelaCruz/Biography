My name is Ram Christian Dela Cruz, I was born on August 4, 1999, in Rosario, Pasig City. I am the middle child of my three siblings. 
I enjoy reading books, mostly sci-fi genres, and playing videogames. My favorite and only sport is swimming. I also like drawing, and editing
stuff in Photoshop even though my art skills are bad.

Since I was in Pre-school, I was enrolled in the same school, Pasig Catholic College, until Grade 12. Now I am studying Electronics Engineering
in the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, I can say that this is a whole new experience for me because I will be going to a completely
different environment and community, but so far, I am enjoying it, and I've learned a lot of things being in a different setting that I've been
used to for many years.

I want to be an Electronics Engineer because I think its cool to work with circuits and programming, and I want to be part of big companies
like Google, Samsung, or Intel.
